# MJO-ICONS

This is a versatile icon library designed for use with JavaScript. It is compatible with any JavaScript framework and can even be used with vanilla Javascript.

The library provides over 49,000 icons that can enhance the user interface of your web applications, creating lightweight packages because only the icons used in the project are imported into the bundle. Easy to integrate and use, this library is a great tool for developers looking to enrich their projects.

## Disclaimer

This library is a fork of the [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/) library. The original library was designed for use with React, but this fork has been modified to work with any JavaScript framework. The library has been stripped of all React-specific code and dependencies, making it compatible with any JavaScript framework and vanilla Javascript.

## Installation

To install the library, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm install mjo-icons
```

## Usage

To use the library, simply import it into your project:

```javascript
import { FaAccusoft } from "mjo-icons/fa";
```

Then, you can use the `FaAccusoft` to print the icon in your HTML, have account that the icon is a string with SVG code:

```javascript
document.myIconDiv.innerHTML = FaAccusoft;
```
